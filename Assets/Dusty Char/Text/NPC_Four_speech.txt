Karl! Glad you made it to this level...the System's Defenses are
 getting stronger.  They've changed the programming on this level
  and you will need to use your glitching ability to jump over 
   these platforms.  
Don't worry Kyle, I'm sure that after a few tries you'll get the 
 hang of it.
(Press 'T' to use your glitching abilities and launch yourself 
  forward to make it onto other platforms)
